#### INSTRUCTIONS ####

Connect four is a two player game, so select who goes first. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row. This can be done in four different directions which are: horizontal, vertical or diagonal (either direction). Each player will insert in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either add on to your row, or block the other players chances from getting four in a row. The game can be over on two seperate occasions, when you or the other player get four in a row, or when all slots are filled, resulting in a draw. If you decide to play again, the loser usually goes first. You can simply restart the game by refreshing the age or hitting the reset button.




^^^^ M V P ^^^^

I want to have a landing page, that will include a button that will lead you to the actual game itself.

On the game page, have different sorts of designs to make my board look presentable.
Have the actual board with the empty slots waiting to be utilized.

Reach the actual goal of the game which is described in the instructions (To have four slots matching by color).


%%%% CHALLENGES %%%%

I foresee myself having challenges with switching turns from one  player to another, also if i wanted to have an AI. 

I want to try to use button down functions to use keys to insert the objects in the slots.

!!!! TECHNOLOGY !!!!

Im plannig on using HTML to build the layout for the content on the page.

CSS to add some style to both pages. (LANDING AND GAME PAGES) 

Javascript & JQuery to add logic to my game. =(
