			Try to connect four of your colored  pieces in a row in the slots provided. This can be done in four different directions which are: horizontal, vertical or *diagonal* (either direction). Each player will insert in one checker piece at a time. This will give you a chance to either add on to your row or column, or block the other players chances from getting four in a row. *under construction*
